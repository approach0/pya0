        "context": "Definition of Equivalence Relation\n\nI was going through the text \"Discrete Mathematics and its Application\" by Kenneth Rosen (5th Edition) where I am across the definition of equivalence relation and felt that it is one sided.  Definition: A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  Now let us analyze the situation of what equivalence is meant to us intuitively. Let there be a binary relation [MASK] defined on a set [MASK]. Now we suppose that [MASK] be reflexive, symmetric and transitive. So we have for [MASK]   [MASK] (by the reflexive property of R) if [MASK] then [MASK]  (by the symmetric property of R) if [MASK] and [MASK] then [MASK] (by the transitive property of R)  Intuitively we can satisfy ourselves with the fact that the above are the necessary conditions for [MASK] to be equivalent. So \"if [MASK] is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, then [MASK] is an equivalence relation\" Now working our intuition for equivalence relation [MASK] we note the following. Let [MASK] be an equivalence relation on a set A, then for [MASK] we have,  [MASK] (by the intuitive knowledge of what [MASK] means) if [MASK] then [MASK] (by the intuitive knowledge of what [MASK] means) if [MASK] and [MASK] then [MASK] (by the intuitive knowledge of what [MASK] means)  Now we see that (1) implies [MASK] is reflexive, (2) implies that [MASK] is symmetric and (3) implies that [MASK] is transitive. So we have \"if [MASK] is an equivalent relation then [MASK] is reflexive, symmetric and transitive\" From the two intuitive implications we can conclude that A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. and not what the book says. This definition makes quite sense unlike the book definition which says that if [MASK] fails to be either reflexive or symmetric or transitive then [imath]R[/imath] may or may not be an equivalence relation, which after all gives a weird feeling.

Is it correct?\n\nI am a Software Engineering student and this year I learned about how CPUs work, it turns out that electronic engineers and I also see it a lot in my field, we do use derivatives with discontinuous functions. For instance in order to calculate the optimal amount of ripple adders so as to minimise the execution time of the addition process: [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] where [MASK] is the number of bits in the numbers to add, [MASK] is the amount of adders in ripple and [MASK] is the \"delta gate\" (the time that takes to a gate to operate). Clearly you can see that the execution time function is not continuous at all because [MASK] is a natural number and so is [MASK]. This is driving me crazy because on the one hand I understand that I can analyse the function as a continuous one and get results in that way, and indeed I think that's what we do (\"I think\", that's why I am asking), but my intuition and knowledge about mathematical analysis tells me that this is completely wrong, because the truth is that the function is not continuous and will never be and because of that, the derivative with respect to [MASK] or [imath]n[/imath] does not exist because there is no rate of change.

Wolfram Mathematica, after a couple of minutes of computing, concluded the series diverges but I can't really trust it. My first approach (assuming the series converges) was that if we bundle up terms with the same sign like the example above every bundle must have three or four terms, and since the first three terms of all bundles make an alternating series I was going to fiddle with the remaining fourth terms but they don't make an alternating series so I guess there's no point in this approach. edit: I don't think we can use Dirichlet's test with [MASK] The alternating cycle here is [MASK] and I don't believe it would bound the series. For example if the cycle was a number very slightly smaller than [MASK], then [MASK] (sum of [MASK]) would get larger and larger every four bundles for some time.
