While this is close, of course, it is not what we want to show.

In fact, every non-principal prime ideal is a maximal ideal, and can be generated by two polynomials. I am wondering whether the same result holds in [MASK]. Can we find a principal ideal [MASK] for some irreducible polynomial [MASK] that is a maximal ideal ?    Such a polynomial [MASK] must have positive degrees in both [MASK] and [MASK]. Indeed, given an irreducible polynomial [MASK] in only one variable, the quotient  [MASK] is a ring of polynomials over a field and as such, can never be a field.   Moreover, such a polynomial [MASK] must have the form  [MASK] where [MASK], the [MASK]'s are polynomials in [MASK] and [MASK] is a nonzero polynomial that vanishes identically on [MASK], thus [MASK] must be divisible by [MASK]. Indeed, if there were some [MASK] such that [MASK], then the ideal [MASK] would contain [MASK] strictly. If [MASK] were to be maximal, [MASK] would be the whole of [MASK]. Writing down the fact that [MASK] and evaluating [MASK] would leads us to the conclusion [MASK], which is absurd.   This is all I could infer so far. With respect to the above, I tried looking at [MASK] or [MASK] in [MASK] for some prime number [imath]p[/imath] but I have trouble determining whether the quotient is a field or not.

Property [imath]T[/imath]: the family is threadless, and it is an \u201calmost-tower\u201d: Whenever you pick two sets in the family, one of them is almost-contained in the other. - probably meaning that we can find such an intersection which is finite, because members are contained in each other. Then I thought.. To find them, I should think of rational numbers instead of natural numbers, remembering that rational numbers can be paired up with natural ones, so solving this problem for families of rational numbers is the same as solving it for families of natural numbers.
